# Noise and Air Pollution in Europe Cities

## Abstract

Environmental noise is part of the daily life of many people. This might be particularly true for the European Union (EU). As one of the world's densely populated and urbanized areas, most people will likely be affected by high environmental noise levels since extensive infrastructure and transportation networks are the main contributors to noise pollution.

Noise pollution substantially impacts the affected local community's physical, mental, and general well-being. Academic research confirmed the consequences of high environmental noise levels on human health (Boes et al., 2013; Schlenker & Walker, 2016) and overall well-being (Lawton & Fujiwara, 2016). Environmental noise can be associated with cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, high heart rates, and lower sleep quality (Babisch et al., 2005; Münzel et al., 2014; Vienneau et al., 2015). So, noise pollution is generally disturbing and detrimental to the individual's health.

<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 1: Noise Pollution in Bolzano (Day vs Night)</strong></h6>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<u style="text-decoration: none;">
    <li>Identified noise sources: Industrial plants, railroads, and streets</li>
    <li>Street noise is the most prominent source</li>
    <li> Noise sources are clustered in the west and the city center; large areas
    in the south and (partially) in the north are completely noise-free</li>

### Noise Exposure by Country

</div>
<h6 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 2: Noise Exposure by Country (Day vs Night)</strong></h6>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<u style="text-decoration: none;">
    <li>Considered countries: Belgium, Germany, and Italy</li>
    <li> Around 10% of the population is exposed to noise levels between 55 dB(A) and 59 dB(A) during the day</li>
    <li>Exposed population's share is decreasing with noise level increases</li>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>
<u style="text-decoration: none;">
    <li>High population density in the city center with grids (size of 1x1km) with 22,000 people</li>
    <li>Population density decreases with increasing distance from the city center</li>
    <li>Low population density in the north-west where large green areas are located</li>

<u style="text-decoration: none;">
    <li>Using the tool of bivariate maps to show the spatial correlation between noise and air pollution</li>
    <li>High noise and air pollution levels in the city center</li>
    <li>High noise pollution around the city center</li>
